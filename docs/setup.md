# Setup
Assuming you have JMeter already installed and running, setting this toolkit up is very simple.

Just download the JAR by clicking [here](https://github.com/damadei/BotServiceStressToolkit/releases) and copy it to the folder `%JMETER_HOME%\lib\ext` if Windows or `$JMETER_HOME\lib\ext` if Linux or Mac.

Restart JMeter and the toolkit actions should be available under the **Config Element** and **Sampler** context menus with the **Bot Service:** prefix.
