# Setup
Assuming you have JMeter already installed and running, setting this toolkit up is very simple.

Just download the JAR by clicking [here](https://github.com/damadei/BotServiceStressToolkit/releases) and copy it to the folder `%JMETER_HOME%\lib\ext` if Windows or `$JMETER_HOME\lib\ext` if Linux or Mac. If you have older versions of the toolkit, make sure you remove them or they will take precedence over the new version.

Restart JMeter and the toolkit actions should be available under the **Config Element** and **Sampler** context menus with the **Bot Service:** prefix.
